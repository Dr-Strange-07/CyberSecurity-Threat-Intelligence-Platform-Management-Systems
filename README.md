# CyberSecurity-Threat-Intelligence-Platform-Management-Systems
That's my Smester project for Database Management System. But I'm trying to do something out of the box. Like instead of DataBase I'm building complete Full stack project on these kind of platforms to protect systems from hacking or threating. It includes DataBase with SQL, Backend with node.js and frontend through React.
